### Question 1

#### Question a

```{r}
load("bikes.Washington.Rdata")

spline_fit_cv <- smooth.spline(bikes$instant, bikes$cnt, cv = TRUE)

# Extract information from the fit with cross-validation
lambda_cv <- spline_fit_cv$spar
lambda_cv
```

The value of the chosen penalty parameter $\lambd$ is 0.2395109, determined by cross-validation.

#### Question b

```{r}
df_cv <- spline_fit_cv$df
df_cv
```

The value of df determined by cross-validation is 95.68039.
#### Question c

```{r}
knots_cv <- spline_fit_cv$fit$knot
print(length(knots_cv))
```

During the smoothing and the regression 140 knots have been used.

#### Question d

```{r}
plot(bikes$instant, bikes$cnt, main = "Scatterplot and Estimated Regression Function (CV)",
     xlab = "instant", ylab = "cnt", col = "blue")
lines(spline_fit_cv, col = "red")
```
